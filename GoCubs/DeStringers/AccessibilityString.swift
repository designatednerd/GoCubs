/**
 A centralized place to store accessibility strings so you can refer to them in both
 the application and tests. Accessiblity strings which might potentially be read
 to the user should be localized so that blind users don't randomly hear the
 developer's language instead of their own.
 
 NOTE: This is an enum instead of a class or a struct so it can't be instantiated.
